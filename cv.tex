        \say{When you solve a puzzle the world makes sense and everything feels right.} (House MD)\\
        Thus I solve puzzles. Mainly from domains of computer science and software engineering. The more I know, the more interesting puzzles I can tackle. I wand to know (and solve) everything, in time.\\
        I'm an enthusiastic programmer and C is my language of choice, though I don't shy away from different ones. During my career I went from debugging to writing drivers, from making Linux kernel boot on new devices, to contributing to ambitious userland projects. I'm looking for an opportunity to expand my knowledge of the field and a chance to polish my skills.
